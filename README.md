# Design System

My React + TypeScript + Vanilla Extract CSS design system with Storybook.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` – production build
- `npm run storybook` – run Storybook locally
- `npm run lint` – lint code
- `npm run test` – run tests

## Vision

Reusable token‑driven components, accessible by default, themed (light/dark), and production‑quality. Ready by Christmas 2025.
